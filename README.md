Electrical Engineering Senior Design by Ethan Cun and Sergio Benavides
Interdisciplinary project with the theater group at UCR and the electrical engineering senior design. 
Animatronic character can be controlled wirelessly over WiFi through a TCP server/client connection. 
The PC (server) connects to the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi (client) using a router to establish the connection.
Run the Python code first to establish the server and then run the Arduino code to connect the client to the server.
Then use the GUI to control the animatronic.
Controls: 
Arrow keys for eyeball movement
Spacebar for blinking
"O" for opening mouth
"P" for closing mouth
"Z" for happy preset
"X" for sad preset
"C" for surprised preset
"," for grin
"." for pout
"R" press once for recording and "R" again to stop recording"
"0-9" to send script depending on where the user saves their recordings
